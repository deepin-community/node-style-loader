Description: style loader module for webpack
 This library is a style loader module for webpack.

 Webpack takes code targeted at node.js and adapts it to run in the browser.

 Webpack exposes this code to programs that are unaware they are running in a
 browser.

 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
